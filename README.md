Agentic AI Paper Reviewer
Overview
This repository contains an Agentic AI-driven research paper reviewing system, leveraging CrewAI to critically assess and refine research papers. The system extracts text from PDF research papers and generates structured, in-depth reviews with automated evaluation, mismatch detection, and refinement.

Key Features
PDF Parsing: Extracts text from research papers using PyMuPDF (fitz).

AI-Powered Review Generation: Creates structured critiques covering all major sections of the paper.

Automated Evaluation: Ensures review depth, specificity, and logical consistency.

Mismatch Flagging: Identifies inconsistencies in critiques and scores.

Final Review Refinement: Ensures professional tone, depth, and fair critique.

Structured Output: Provides a final review with a rating (1-10), acceptance decision (Strong Reject â†’ Strong Accept), and confidence score (1-5).

How It Works
Extract: Parses research paper PDFs from the ICLR_2020_papers/ directory.

Generate Review: Uses an AI agent to create an initial structured review.

Evaluate: A separate AI agent assesses the review for depth, politeness, and consistency.

Flag Mismatches: Detects contradictions and ensures ratings align with critiques.

Refine Final Review: Incorporates feedback and produces a polished, expert-level review.

Save Output: Stores the final review as a text file in the ICLR_2020_LLM_reviews/ directory.
